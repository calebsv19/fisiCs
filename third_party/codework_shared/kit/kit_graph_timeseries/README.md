# kit_graph_timeseries

`kit_graph_timeseries` is the shared time-series visualization kit built on top of `kit_render`.

It provides reusable plotting helpers for line-series visualization without tying plotting behavior to any single app.

## Current Scope

This module now provides:

- view-range computation from sample data
- line plot rendering for one or more series
- plot clipping
- optional axes and grid lines
- simple legend labels
- hover inspection helper for nearest-point lookup
- hover crosshair and marker overlay drawing
- view zoom helper
- render-stride guidance for lightweight decimation of dense sample sets

The current scope is intentionally focused on practical plotting fundamentals. It is the first reusable graphing layer for DataLab-style and metrics-style visualization.

## Boundary

`kit_graph_timeseries` owns:

- plotting transforms from data space to plot space
- generic line-series rendering
- generic plot presentation helpers
- graph-specific hover inspection and overlay helpers
- simple draw-time decimation guidance
- helper-owned hover overlay label formatting for the current frame

`kit_graph_timeseries` does not own:

- file formats
- dataset storage policy
- app-specific analysis transforms
- pane lifecycle
- domain-specific meaning of the data
- app-managed series memory, label lifetime, or retained hover state

## Contract Notes

- `KitGraphTsSeries.xs`, `.ys`, and `.label` are borrowed caller-owned inputs.
- Legend labels remain borrowed and must stay alive through frame command consumption.
- `kit_graph_ts_draw_hover_overlay(...)` now formats its own hover label into persistent helper-owned rolling storage so overlay text no longer depends on a stack-local buffer.
- `kit_graph_ts_hover_inspect(...)` uses the default shared graph padding when mapping hover positions. If a host draws with custom padding, it must pass hover bounds that already match that effective inner plot region.
- Non-finite sample values are rejected at the shared boundary rather than silently flowing into view, hover, or draw math.
- The validation harness is still manual; automated Vulkan parity is not part of the current contract.

## Progress

Implemented now:

1. shared plot and series contracts
2. automatic view computation from sample buffers
3. line plot rendering through `kit_render`
4. grid and axes support
5. hover inspection helper
6. hover overlay drawing
7. zoom helper
8. decimation/stride helper for dense series
9. Vulkan validation harness
10. internal split between math helpers and draw helpers so apps can reuse plotting math incrementally
11. first app adoption slice landed: DataLab reused shared stride guidance for trace decimation
12. bounded hardening now covers non-finite rejection, command-buffer failure propagation, and hover-label lifetime safety
13. bounded DataLab trace graph adoption now routes view computation, zoom,
    hover inspection, plot drawing, and hover overlay drawing through the
    shared kit while leaving trace/session meaning app-owned

## Planned Growth

1. add panning helpers
2. add multi-plot dashboard helpers
3. expand toward spectrum and heatmap variants
4. support richer inspector composition for app-level tools
5. consider style-aware hover inspection only if real adopters need non-default plot padding

## Adoption Note

DataLab now uses `kit_graph_timeseries` for bounded trace graph rendering:
shared view computation, zoom, hover inspection, plot draw commands, and hover
overlay commands route through the kit, while DataLab keeps sample/session
ownership, trace lane meaning, cursor policy, and SDL replay local.

## Build

```sh
make -C shared/kit/kit_graph_timeseries
```

The static library is rebuilt from a clean archive member list each time so removed objects do not linger after internal refactors.

## Test

```sh
make -C shared/kit/kit_graph_timeseries test
```

## Validation Harness

Build the Vulkan validation harness:

```sh
make -C shared/kit/kit_graph_timeseries clean validation-harness KIT_RENDER_ENABLE_VK=1
```

Run it:

```sh
./shared/kit/kit_graph_timeseries/build/kit_graph_timeseries_vk_validation
```

Expected behavior:

1. a left control panel with series selection, overlay toggle, and detail slider
2. a right plot panel with a dense time-series graph
3. mouse wheel zoom changes the visible plot range
4. overlay mode shows a crosshair and hover marker that follows the nearest point
5. the info readout reflects the current render stride for the active detail level
