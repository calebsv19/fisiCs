# kit_ui

`kit_ui` is the shared immediate-mode widget and layout helper kit built on top of `kit_render`.

It provides pane-hostable UI primitives that render through shared draw commands instead of owning any pane or runtime lifecycle.

## Current Scope (Immediate-Mode Helpers)

This module now provides:

- stack layout helpers (`vstack`, `hstack`)
- label drawing
- button drawing
- richer button spec/state/layout/style helpers for selected, pressed, focused, and variant-aware controls
- rounded/compact button appearance presets for HUD-style control surfaces
- HUD-style floating surface/button-row layout helpers with alpha-preserving
  dark floating defaults and nested-corner inset helpers
- optional SDL rounded-surface/button/readout/scrollbar adapter helpers through
  `kit_ui_sdl.h`
- checkbox drawing
- slider drawing
- scrollbar drawing for viewport-style panels
- segmented control drawing
- input-state, hit-testing, and simple behavior evaluation helpers
- theme-driven colors through `kit_render` and `core_theme`
- font-role-aware text through `kit_render` and `core_font`

The implementation is still intentionally immediate-mode. The goal is reusable, testable shared controls for graph inspectors and tool panels, not a full retained-mode framework.

## Boundary

`kit_ui` owns:

- widget rendering helpers
- widget visual states
- simple layout allocation helpers
- reusable control composition
- light interaction helpers for shared tools
- clip-stack helpers layered onto the active `kit_render` frame
- text-measure and text-fit helpers that reuse `kit_render` metrics when available and fall back to lightweight estimates otherwise
- HUD control-row geometry and default alpha-aware chrome styles while callers
  keep action dispatch and domain policy
- nested rounded-surface radius math for inset control rows
- optional SDL rounded-surface drawing helpers for plain SDL hosts that are not
  yet submitting those overlays through `kit_render` command frames

`kit_ui` does not own:

- pane lifecycle
- event loop ownership
- retained widget trees
- keyboard focus or text input ownership
- layout document loading
- settings or action persistence
- application-specific behavior
- mandatory SDL or event-loop dependencies in the default `kit_ui` library
- app theme-preset persistence or app-specific token-to-surface policy

## Contract Notes

- `KitUiContext.render_ctx` is borrowed and must outlive the UI context.
- All draw helpers are immediate-mode frame helpers. Borrowed label/text pointers only need to remain valid through the current render frame command consumption.
- `kit_ui` writes commands into the caller-owned `KitRenderCommandBuffer` attached to the active `KitRenderFrame`; it does not retain widget state across frames.
- Clip-stack depth is bounded by `KIT_UI_CLIP_STACK_MAX`.
- `kit_ui_fit_text_to_rect(...)` chooses the largest full-fit tier first, then falls back to the smallest height-fitting tier with ellipsis truncation.
- The Vulkan validation harness is a host-side debug harness, not part of the shared widget contract itself.

## Progress

Implemented now:

1. base UI context and style defaults
2. stack layout allocation helpers
3. button, checkbox, slider, scrollbar, segmented, and label rendering helpers
4. command emission through `kit_render`
5. input-state, hit-testing, and simple behavior evaluation helpers
6. a live Vulkan validation harness for interactive widget checks
7. additive custom label/button drawing variants so callers can pick font role and text size tier when the default control text is too rigid
8. additive theme-scale style sync via `kit_ui_style_apply_theme_scale(...)` so contexts can derive density from the active shared theme preset
9. additive top-anchor content-height helper for virtualized row lists (`kit_ui_scroll_content_height_top_anchor(...)`)
10. additive clip-stack helpers with nested intersection and pixel-snapped clip rects (`kit_ui_clip_push(...)`, `kit_ui_clip_pop(...)`, `kit_ui_clip_stack_reset(...)`) for pane-safe scrolling and overlap prevention
11. additive text-measure and text-fit helpers (`kit_ui_measure_text(...)`, `kit_ui_fit_text_to_rect(...)`) for reusable width/height-aware label fitting with tier selection and ellipsis fallback
12. additive richer button semantics (`kit_ui_button_*`, `kit_ui_draw_button_spec(...)`) so hosts can share selected/pressed/focused/variant-aware button styling without inventing app-local contracts first
13. additive 1px button-outline hardening so shared button borders avoid corner overrun artifacts across snapped pixel densities by emitting edge rects instead of endpoint-sensitive line segments
14. additive rounded/compact button appearance presets (`kit_ui_button_appearance_*`, `kit_ui_draw_button_spec_appearance(...)`) for HUD-style transport controls without changing existing button callers
15. additive HUD button-row layout helpers (`kit_ui_hud_button_row_*`) plus
    alpha-aware floating HUD style defaults for compact transport/control
    surfaces
16. optional SDL adapter helpers (`kit_ui_sdl_*`) for hosts that still draw
    active overlays through `SDL_Renderer` instead of a retained `kit_render`
    backend
17. additive corner/inset helpers (`kit_ui_corner_radius_for_inset(...)`,
    `kit_ui_corner_radius_clamp(...)`, `kit_ui_rect_inset(...)`) so nested HUD
    controls can match an outer rounded panel by deriving the inner radius from
    `outer_radius - inset`

## Planned Growth

1. add focus and keyboard-navigation helpers
2. add binding adapters for settings/action/telemetry keys
3. add simple row/list helpers for inspectors
4. remain the common control surface for settings, graph inspectors, and debug panes
5. keep app-specific button preference layers above the shared `kit_ui_button_*` semantic contract unless a second host proves a reusable policy

## HUD Button Rows and SDL Adapter

Use `kit_ui_hud_button_row_layout(...)` when a host needs a compact floating
control bar with fixed-size buttons and an optional readout lane. The helper
solves the rounded panel, button rects, and readout rect while preserving the
caller-owned button labels, enabled state, selected state, and action dispatch.

Use `kit_ui_hud_style_dark_floating(...)` for the current translucent dark HUD
chrome. The style stores alpha directly in `KitRenderColor.a`, and
`kit_ui_color_with_alpha(...)` provides a small alpha override helper for hosts
that need to tune opacity without changing RGB values.

Hosts may also adapt an app-selected `core_theme` / custom palette into
`KitUiHudStyle` before drawing. In that shape, `kit_ui` still owns the style
fields, alpha-aware layout, and corner math, while the host owns which theme
preset is active and how app-local custom tokens map to HUD surfaces. DataLab
is the current proving host for this pattern: its session and playback HUDs use
shared HUD chrome, but DataLab owns file navigation, playback policy, and
theme/custom-palette persistence.

For nested HUD rows, derive control/readout radius with
`kit_ui_hud_button_row_control_corner_radius(...)` after the row config is
filled. This applies the shared corner rule: inner rounded controls match the
outer panel by using `panel_radius - row_pad`, then clamping to the available
control dimensions. That keeps the panel, padding, buttons, and readout visually
aligned across scale changes and narrow responsive layouts.

Plain SDL hosts can include `kit_ui_sdl.h` and compile `src/kit_ui_sdl.c` as an
optional adapter. The adapter draws rounded panel/buttons/readouts through
`SDL_Renderer`, preserves alpha on every fill, and delegates text measuring and
clipped text drawing back to the host through callbacks. This keeps font/cache
ownership app-local while sharing the HUD/button chrome.

This SDL adapter is intentionally a bridge, not a replacement for
`kit_render`: hosts that already submit overlay frames through `kit_render`
should continue to use command-frame UI helpers. The adapter exists for active
plain-SDL overlays where adopting the shared HUD expression first is cleaner
than forcing a renderer migration.

`kit_ui_sdl_scrollbar_layout(...)` and `kit_ui_sdl_draw_scrollbar(...)` mirror
the shared command-frame scrollbar geometry (6px track inset 8px from the
right edge and a 10% minimum thumb) for direct SDL hosts. The host keeps scroll
offset and pointer routing; `kit_ui` owns the common visual geometry.

## Theme-Scale Style Sync

`kit_ui_context_init(...)` now seeds `KitUiStyle` from the active theme scale in the attached `KitRenderContext`.

Apps that switch theme presets at runtime can re-sync density by calling:

```c
kit_ui_style_apply_theme_scale(&ui_ctx);
```

This keeps spacing and control sizing aligned with shared theme presets instead of relying only on hardcoded app-local constants.

## Text Fit Helpers

Use `kit_ui_fit_text_to_rect(...)` when control text needs to adapt to tight bounds without app-local heuristics.

The helper:

1. picks the largest candidate text tier that fits the target rect
2. falls back to measured ellipsis fitting when width is constrained
3. reports the final tier/metrics/truncation through `KitUiTextFitResult`

This keeps list rows, graph nodes, and chip/button labels consistent across apps.

## Button Appearance Presets

Use `kit_ui_button_appearance_preset(...)` with
`kit_ui_draw_button_spec_appearance(...)` when a host needs rounded or compact
button chrome while keeping action behavior app-owned.

Current presets:

- `KIT_UI_BUTTON_APPEARANCE_DEFAULT`: square legacy-compatible geometry values.
- `KIT_UI_BUTTON_APPEARANCE_ROUNDED`: rounded general-purpose controls.
- `KIT_UI_BUTTON_APPEARANCE_COMPACT_ROUNDED`: tighter HUD/control-bar buttons.
- `KIT_UI_BUTTON_APPEARANCE_PILL`: large radius that clamps to the control
  bounds at draw time.

The appearance struct is intentionally editable by callers: radius, border
thickness, and padding can be adjusted per host without adding app-specific
policy to `kit_ui`.

## Build

```sh
make -C shared/kit/kit_ui
```

## Test

```sh
make -C shared/kit/kit_ui test
```

## Validation Harness

Build the live Vulkan UI harness:

```sh
make -C shared/kit/kit_ui clean validation-harness KIT_RENDER_ENABLE_VK=1
```

Run it:

```sh
./shared/kit/kit_ui/build/kit_ui_vk_validation
```

Expected behavior:

1. a left control panel with a title, segmented mode switcher, button, checkbox, slider, and status text
2. a scrollable event log panel on the lower left; use the mouse wheel while the cursor is over that panel
3. a right visualization panel that changes between bars, trend lines, and mixed mode based on the segmented control
4. clicking `Run Action` causes a brief visual accent change
5. clicking `Enable Overlay` toggles the `LIVE OVERLAY` label
6. dragging the slider changes the visualization intensity and the status percentage text

Press `Esc` or close the window to exit.
