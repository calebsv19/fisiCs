## Notes on Current Reality
- `map_forge` tile-loader lane is now on shared execution core (`queue/sched/jobs/workers/wake/kernel`) with additive migration.
- `map_forge` Slice 2 adds shared `core_queue` handoff usage in `app_tile_pipeline` (`vk_asset` ready queue), while preserving existing worker/stage behavior.
- `map_forge` Slice 3 adds shared `core_queue` handoff usage in `app_tile_pipeline` (`vk_poly_prep` in/out queues), while preserving existing worker lifecycle and prep behavior.
- `map_forge` Slice 4 diagnostics contract guard is complete: deterministic `test_build_safety.sh` assertions now lock required `meta.dataset.json` schema/table keys, and deterministic `map_trace_contract_test` now locks shared trace pack chunk contract (`TRHD/TRSM/TREV`) plus canonical runtime lane/marker vocabulary (including lifecycle `trace_start/trace_end`).
- `map_forge` Slice 5 trace pack parity guard is complete: deterministic `map_trace_contract_test` now locks strict shared trace pack parity with exact chunk count/order and deterministic payload sizes for `TRSM`/`TREV`.
- `daw` mainthread loop now uses shared execution-core modules (`core_queue/core_sched/core_jobs/core_wake/core_kernel`) with additive behavior; `core_workers` is now partially adopted in diagnostics async export lanes.
- `daw` Slice 2 pack/data guard is complete: deterministic `daw_pack_contract_parity_test` now validates canonical `core_pack` chunk contract and embedded `core_data` dataset schema keys.
- `daw` Slice 3 data contract hardening is complete: additive dataset metadata keys (`schema_family`, `schema_variant`) and canonical `daw_selection_v1` table are now locked by deterministic parity coverage.
- `daw` Slice 4 trace diagnostics lane is complete: deterministic `daw_trace_export_contract_test` validates canonical `core_trace` lanes (`frame_dt`, `transport_frame`, scheduler timing/count lanes) and `trace_start/trace_end` markers.
- `daw` Slice 5 workers lane is complete: async diagnostics trace export now uses shared `core_workers` with deterministic completion/contract coverage (`daw_trace_export_async_contract_test`).
- `daw` has no mandatory shared-lib connection gap in the current rollout plan; remaining shared work is optional consolidation/hardening.
- `core_wake` is at `1.0.1` (standards-safe timeout constant update), and downstream checks pass.
- `core_data` + `core_pack` remain mostly additive/export-path integrations in several apps (`daw`, `ray_tracing`, `map_forge`, `ide`, `fisiCs`) rather than full runtime-domain ownership.
- Shared theme/font adapters are now default-on in the current UI app set (`daw`, `ide`, `line_drawing`, `line_drawing3d`, `map_forge`, `ray_tracing`, `physics_sim`), with app-local persistence added for runtime preset selection.
- `core_font` is now at `1.0.1` with shared-asset fallback paths aligned to real font files in `shared/assets/fonts`, reducing bitmap fallback in kit Vulkan text rendering.
- `kit_render` is now at `0.10.0` with additive runtime theme/font preset setters and a TTF-first Vulkan text path (with bitmap fallback), allowing live preset switching plus substantially improved text legibility in kit-hosted Vulkan UIs.
- `kit_ui` is now at `0.8.0` with additive theme-scale style sync (`kit_ui_style_apply_theme_scale`), allowing UI density to track active shared theme presets at runtime.
- `kit_graph_timeseries` is now at `0.2.1`, and DataLab has started incremental adoption via shared stride guidance.
- `kit_graph_struct` is now at `0.8.0`.
- `core_memdb` is now at `0.24.10` with additive event-dual-write, full-field replay-check, deterministic projection rebuild/apply, and event-first projection apply in-transaction across all mutation lanes (`add`, `pin`, `canonical`, `rollup`, `link-add`, `link-update`, `link-remove`): schema target v6, built-in v1->v2->v3->v4->v5->v6 migration on open, append-only `mem_event` table + indexes (`event_id`, `ts_ns`, `event_type`, `session_id`), `mem_cli event-list` for bounded event inspection, `mem_cli event-replay-check` for full-field parity checks between replayed event projection and live rows, `mem_cli event-replay-apply` for source->target projection rebuild + parity verification, snapshot-backed payload emission on key write commands, and `mem_cli event-backfill` for upgrading legacy minimal events into replay-complete history while preserving existing scoped retrieval, `mem_audit` coverage, session budgets, bounded neighbors, link constraints, dedupe-aware add behavior, and transactional rollup.
- `mem_console` (top-level program host) includes an optional (`--kernel-bridge`) evaluation scaffold over `core_sched` + `core_jobs` + `core_wake` + `core_kernel`; this is additive host validation and is not yet a production-app matrix requirement.
- `mem_console` (top-level program host) serializes theme/font UI prefs through `core_pack` (`<db_path>.ui.pack`) as app-local persistence.
- `mem_console` (top-level program host) now evaluates shared `core_pane` (`0.1.0`) for split-pane solve + draggable splitter interaction in the 15C lane, with pane-ratio persistence wired through app-local prefs packs.
- `core_pane` is now at `0.1.2` with additive splitter-drag accumulation fix (apply delta from live node ratio, avoiding stale-hit tug-of-war behavior in iterative drags), while retaining prior invalid-graph/non-finite hardening coverage.
- `kit_pane` is now scaffolded at `0.1.0` with baseline pane chrome/splitter rendering helpers and null-backend unit tests; adoption into app hosts is deferred behind workspace sandbox gates.
- `kit_runtime_diag` is now at `0.1.0` with baseline stage timing + input totals helpers, and `map_forge` now adopts it for runtime perf diagnostics math/counter accumulation while keeping routing/render behavior app-local.
- `workspace_sandbox` runtime now owns `core_action` registry/binding storage and exposes trigger-resolve + action-execute APIs, with the visual harness delegating key routing through that shared runtime path.
- `workspace_sandbox` runtime now uses shared `core_layout` as source-of-truth for mode transitions, pending-change tracking, revision counters, and rebuild acknowledgment semantics.
- `workspace_sandbox` runtime now uses shared `core_config` for split-authoring defaults (`split.default_ratio`, `split.min_size_a`, `split.min_size_b`) instead of hardcoded split creation constants.
- `workspace_sandbox` visual run path now auto-loads/saves session preset state (`workspace_sandbox/data/last_session.pack`) for close/reopen pane-layout persistence during iterative authoring.
- `workspace_sandbox` P12 lane has started: authoring-mode divider hit-test + drag now routes through runtime APIs backed by `core_pane` splitter primitives.
- `workspace_sandbox` P12 lane now includes first structural reorder operation (`workspace.reorder_next`, key `R`) routed through runtime-owned `core_action` dispatch.
- `workspace_sandbox` P12 lane now supports explicit two-pane swap interaction in authoring mode (`click` then `Shift+click`) via runtime API `workspace_sandbox_swap_panes`.
- `workspace_sandbox` corner/seam lane C1 is complete: runtime now exposes derived seam/junction graph build API (`workspace_sandbox_build_derived_graph`), and harness corner visualization consumes that deterministic graph path.
- `workspace_sandbox` corner/seam lane C2 is complete: splitter drag now supports immediate corner-to-corner snapping (16px radius) with topology-preferred candidate ranking and snap-target glow in the harness.
- `workspace_sandbox` corner/seam lane C3 has started with first rewrite slice: `Alt` orthogonal-drag threshold (`24px`) arms `promote_center_cross`, with hard-cancel and console reason on invalid rewrites.
- future-work note: `shared/docs/memory_db_autonomous_maintenance/` (Plan 01-03) is planning-only and not yet counted as implemented runtime/adoption state in this snapshot.
- detailed per-program connective-tissue snapshot now lives in `shared/docs/ecosystem_north_star_docs/44_program_library_connective_tissue_state.md`.
