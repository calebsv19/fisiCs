# Ecosystem Core & Kit Catalog
## Purpose
This document is the canonical catalog of shared ecosystem components.
It describes what exists now, what is planned next, and how responsibilities stay separated.

This is not an implementation guide.

**Role:** SDL/Vulkan presentation backend beneath `kit_render`.
**Responsibilities:**
