# core_mesh_compile

Shared compile-boundary helpers for the mesh-asset rollout.

## Scope
- Shared staged instance-contract helpers for the pending `mesh_asset_instance` scene lane
- Shared authored-source compile-boundary helpers for producing
  `mesh_asset_runtime_v1` from validated `mesh_asset_authoring_v1`
- Bounded imported-mesh compile proof for ASCII and binary STL fixtures
- File-backed imported-mesh compile output for downstream app fixtures
- Shared vocabulary for:
  - geometry-ref kind
  - staged instance object type
  - runtime compile variant label
- JSON-free validation for:
  - staged mesh-asset scene instances
  - referenced asset id and optional variant
  - base object dimensional-mode policy for mesh-asset instances
  - authored source modes that must emit runtime mesh assets
  - imported-mesh authored sources that require import metadata before compile
  - emitted runtime mesh documents for bounded STL imports
  - emitted runtime mesh files for bounded STL imports
  - angle-weighted smooth and crease-aware runtime vertex normals

## Boundaries
- No JSON parsing or writing
- STL import is bounded to the proof-scale path:
  - max imported STL triangles: `3000000`
  - larger inputs must be rejected before runtime mesh allocation
  - mesh repair, retopo, LOD/streaming policy, and host import UX remain out of
    scope
- No ownership of authored/runtime asset semantics (`core_mesh_asset` owns those)
- No long-term scene-envelope ownership (`core_scene` will absorb scene-instance semantics in the next rollout step)
- No renderer/solver import behavior

## Current Contract (v0.7.0)
- Supported geometry-ref kind is exactly:
  - `mesh_asset`
- Supported staged instance object type is exactly:
  - `mesh_asset_instance`
- `core_mesh_compile_instance_contract_validate(...)` currently validates only the staged bridge contract:
  - valid base `core_object` identity/flags/transform
  - `object_type=mesh_asset_instance`
  - full-3D dimensional mode
  - non-empty referenced `asset_id`
  - optional `variant` and `material_ref_id` remain plain identifiers only
- `core_mesh_compile_authoring_contract_prepare(...)` now validates a
  `CoreMeshAssetAuthoringDocument` and prepares the compile responsibility
  contract for emitted runtime mesh assets:
  - records source asset id and runtime asset id
  - records the authoring source mode
  - requires runtime mesh asset emission
  - preserves surface group ids as a compile-boundary promise
  - marks `imported_mesh` sources as requiring imported-mesh source metadata
- `core_mesh_compile_imported_mesh_to_runtime_document(...)` now provides the
  first bounded compile proof:
  - accepts validated `imported_mesh` authored documents
  - resolves relative source URIs against a caller-provided source root
  - parses bounded ASCII STL and binary STL fixture/proof input
  - rejects STL input above the proof-scale triangle ceiling
  - skips zero-area/degenerate STL triangles before runtime document emission
  - rejects STL inputs when no non-degenerate triangles remain
  - applies authored `source_to_asset_scale`
  - welds duplicate vertices according to authored weld settings through a
    spatial hash index rather than a full linear scan
  - emits one validated `CoreMeshAssetRuntimeDocument`
  - assigns all triangles to the authored default surface group
  - optionally emits angle-weighted smooth vertex normals from welded indexed
    topology
  - optionally splits vertices into edge-connected smoothing islands at the
    authored crease angle, while keeping surface-group boundaries isolated
- `core_mesh_compile_imported_mesh_to_runtime_document_with_progress(...)`
  mirrors the bounded compile proof while optionally reporting coarse progress
  stages for preparing, source read, STL parse, runtime emission, and complete.
- `core_mesh_compile_imported_mesh_to_runtime_file(...)` now saves the emitted
  runtime document as file-backed `mesh_asset_runtime_v1` JSON.

## Status
- Bootstrap staging module created so fixtures and validation can land before `core_scene` integration.
- v0.7.0 adds opt-in angle-weighted smooth and crease-aware vertex-normal
  generation. The topology path uses welded indices and edge-connected face
  neighborhoods rather than render-acceleration proximity, and normal logic is
  isolated in `core_mesh_compile_normals.c`. When inconsistent legacy winding
  cancels an angle-weighted vertex sum, smooth mode deterministically falls back
  to the first valid incident face normal instead of rejecting the whole mesh.
- v0.6.6 keeps the binary STL size guard warning-clean under strict Linux
  C11 builds where `size_t` is wider than the 32-bit STL triangle-count field.
- v0.6.5 raises the bounded imported STL proof ceiling to `3000000`
  triangles so the private high-triangle sidecar lane can run the x3 Stanford
  Dragon upper-range proof while repair, retopo, LOD/streaming, and host UX
  stay out of scope.
- v0.6.4 raises the bounded imported STL proof ceiling to `2000000`
  triangles so private high-triangle sidecar generation can cover the current
  generated `1.74M` raw-triangle stress candidate while repair, retopo,
  LOD/streaming, and host UX stay out of scope.
- v0.6.3 raises the bounded imported STL proof ceiling to `1000000`
  triangles so private high-triangle sidecar generation can cover sub-million
  scan fixtures while repair, retopo, LOD/streaming, and host UX stay out of
  scope.
- v0.6.2 adds an optional progress-callback compile entry point for imported
  STL work so app hosts can surface long-running parse/weld/runtime-emission
  state without owning compiler internals.
- v0.6.1 hardens dirty STL import by skipping zero-area/degenerate ASCII and
  binary STL triangles before runtime mesh validation while continuing to reject
  files that contain no valid triangle payload.
- v0.6.0 adds proof-scale mesh-size guardrails and replaces the imported STL
  weld scan with an indexed weld path so larger user/Sparrow-scale STL probes
  can run without quadratic duplicate-vertex lookup.
- v0.5.0 adds binary STL parsing behind the existing imported-mesh compile API
  while preserving ASCII STL support and the same runtime document output
  contract.
- v0.4.0 adds file-backed runtime mesh output for bounded imported STL compile
  proofs so consumers such as RayTracing can load generated runtime assets
  through their existing file-backed mesh-asset paths.
- v0.3.0 adds the first bounded imported STL to runtime mesh document compile
  proof. It is intentionally fixture-scale and does not cover repair, editor
  import UX, RayTracing material policy, or PhysicsSim collision derivation.
- v0.2.0 freezes the first authoring-to-runtime compile responsibility
  contract.
